We took as our starting point this initial network ethnography completed by Joe Hanley that can be viewed here.\n\n\n\nInclusion Criteria\nPeople (and the relevant organisation) are included if they met any of the following criteria:\nThey work for or have worked for an organization\nThey are/were listed as a supporter, partner or funder of an organisation\nThey are/were part of a whole organisation/multi-project advisory board for an organisation (this excludes single project advisory)\nThey have/had a formal official role with an organisation (including board member/director/trustee)\nThey are/were a public ambassador or fellow for an organisation\nIndividuals with a significant role in the Children’s Social Care Review and Initial Teacher Training Market Review were also included to demonstrate the interconnectivity of projects of this nature\nThey are one of the academics listed above who are involved in the development of this map.\nThe following exclusion criterion was also applied:\nThe person only has one notable connection.\nInclusion criteria 1-5 should be self-explanatory. We added inclusion criterion 6 as these two Reviews are current, have a high public profile, may have a significant impact on children’s services and policy, and because they help demonstrate the interconnectivity of projects of this nature. We included ourselves (inclusion criterion 7) in order to provide some transparency regarding our own noted connections, and this provides a point of comparison with others in the network diagram if wanted. We applied exclusion criterion 1 in order to simplify the map.\nIn addition, only connections that could be verified by publicly available online sources were included, and each of these sources has been included in the map (all sources have been archived for posterity). Familial connections were not included, although there are a number of these between individuals in the map. The focus was primarily on England, but the global nature of modern networks means that at times it crosses borders. The focus was also on Children’s Services and links to central government, and therefore to simplify the map only two government departments have been included, the Department for Education and the Cabinet Office. However, it is important to highlight that many in the map also have links to other government departments.\nSearching for connections took place entirely over the internet, and the map was expanded until it reached approximately 1000 connections, with anyone who met the criteria that was identified included. Searching for connections on the internet carries with it certain biases. There are likely to be others who exercise influence less openly – but it is also fitting in that it captures known and public connections that have not previously been comprehensively mapped in this way. The spreadsheet containing all the information and connections can also be viewed here.\n\n\n\nUses of the Map\nWe see a number of possible uses for this map, including:\nUnderstanding and tracing policy networks,\nUnderstanding who’s who when it comes to leadership, appointments, contracts etc.,\nFollowing policy as it moves through and gains consensus from these networks,\nRecognising how interlinked many seemingly disconnected organisations and individuals actually are,\nRecognising the level of influence that private organisations can have in our public services.\nWe recognise that some may suggest that such networks are merely the way policy development and services ‘work’, and that may be the case. If that is the case, then there should be similarly no issue with documenting these networks clearly and transparently so that people may draw their own conclusions about their significance (or otherwise). We believe that seeking to better understand these networks, and their influence, is a potentially important contribution to our understanding policy making and influence in a post-industrial liberal democratic state.\n\n\n\nCorrections and Connections\nIt is important to note that the large number of connections highlighted here mean that there are likely some errors in the map and the document. If anyone spots an error, they are encouraged to fill out the following form to let us know: corrections form. This spreadsheet and map is intended to serve as a snapshot of several months, and therefore it is also possible that some of the connections are out of date or need updating.\nWe also encourage anyone to suggest new connections, and we will endeavour to create additional snapshots in the future (our personal time and resources notwithstanding). Please ensure that any suggested additions meet the criteria outlined above, and can be verified by online sources. Additions can be suggested using the following form: additions form.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nThis page shows descriptive statistics for the network analysis with the fifteen highest scoring organisational and individual nodes for values of degree, closeness, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality (described in each section). A discussion is also included that briefly considers the implications of this analysis, and in particular the implications for the Children’s Social Care Review in England currently being chaired by Josh MacAlister.\n\n\n\nDegree/Strength\nDegree, or strength, represents the direct influence of each node in the network based on the number of immediate connections they share with other nodes. High strength can represent the size of an organisation or the nature of an individual’s work — for example, in positions that focus on building professional collaborations. In addition, high degree can reflect the transparency of organisations or individuals publicly documenting their involvement with other actors.\n\n\nhtml {\n  font-family: -apple-system,

smaller than the numbers of connections documented at an organisational level.\n\n\n\nCloseness\nCloseness measures how many steps are required to access every other node from a given node, expressed as inverse distance meaning that higher scores reflect those with the closest distance. In communications, closeness can be used to estimate who is most likely to receive information travelling across the network first, on average (in this case, through only formal partnerships which may therefore include more privileged information). In this sense, closeness can be used as an approximation of which nodes in the network are best able to quickly reach all other actors in the network.\n\n\nhtml {\n  font-family: -apple-system,

dominated by chief executives (or equivalent positions) of charities where closeness is often higher than those of senior civil servants in public positions. After Josh MacAlister, senior executives from three non-public organisations are rated higher in closeness than the first individual within the public sector representing the Office for Students. There are then a further four senior executives outside of the public sector before the next public sector representative with high closeness, the Chief Social Worker for Children and Families.\n\n\n\nBetweenness\nBetweenness is a measure of gatekeeping or brokerage potential. Rather than direct influence or at pace information sharing potential, betweenness measures the number of times a given node falls along the shortest path between nodes. In other words, nodes with high betweenness can exert a high degree of influence over a network by enabling or blocking the shortest (formal) routes of connection. Those who have high degree/strength values are also likely to have high betweenness, but so are those who act as a bridge between very different sectors.\n\n\nhtml {\n  font-family: -apple-system,

people, there is large representation among high eigenvector centrality nodes of individuals from the private/not-for-profit education sector.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nNetworks, connections, relationships, and influence should not be interpreted as a straightforwardly negative factor. Indeed, on one hand, a fair argument is that a high degree of interconnectedness with others across a spectrum of services and initiatives is essential for creating the consensus that is needed to create change. These descriptive statistics support the idea that if the aim in setting up the Children’ Social Care Review was to identify the single most efficient chair for galvanising connection across an existing network of formal and professional connections, Josh MacAlister was — statistically speaking — the most optimal choice that could have been made.\nHowever, shining a light on what the composition of that established network looks like is a worthwhile goal. Within the most dominant actors in the network we see very high representation from organisations and policy actors that are focused on ‘transformation’, particularly transformation of the public sector, predominantly in education reform. This highlights potentially interesting avenues to explore, identifying what parallels (or divergence) in policy reform might be found between education and children’s social care and social work given the significant crossover of actors found in the network.\nConspicuous in their absence when it comes to influence over a network whose most central actors have been tasked with boldly transforming children’s social care are organisations that represent social work and social workers. From what is publicly known, only one prominent civil servant shares comparable levels of influence in this network to that of a much larger group of chief executives and other senior members of private or not-for-profit organisations. Other than the Children’s Social Care Review and the Department of Education itself, only one other overtly social work and children’s social care focused organisation shares the level of influence that education-focused charities, charitable foundations, social entrepeneurs, and a large consulting firm hold.\nRegardless of opinion on these individuals/organisation’s work or influence, they are now in the likely unfavourable position of being the most likely to be asked to represent the entire gamut of diversity of opinion in children and families social work. Would a different chair of the Care Review have resulted in a more balanced network of social work organisations and pubic actors? Or does the fault lie with a failure of social work organisations and individual actors to build or maintain formal networks and coalitions in the time leading to the Care Review?\n\n\n\n",

The amount of information we are faced with can make it difficult to understand bigger pictures.\nThis project collated and archived over 1,000 publicly documented connections between policymakers; public, private and third sector organisations; individuals; and other actors between 7th May 2021 and the 1st November 2021, drawing them into a single network map. The network map visualisation is interactive — you can click on any actor to read a brief description of their work in Children’s Services, or on any line between actors to view details about their link.\nClick on the Interactive Network Map link above to view the network visualisation. Click on the About link to view more information about the project, including links to the underlying data and forms to submit corrections or additional connections. We have also provided some statistical analysis of the data, and a brief discussion on the map’s relevance to the Review of Children’s Social Care 2021.\n\n\n\n",
